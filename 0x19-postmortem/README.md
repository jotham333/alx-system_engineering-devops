**Title: Postmortem - Web Stack Outage Incident**

**Date and Time:**
*Duration:* 4 hours, 2023-11-12 14:00 - 18:00 (UTC)

**Incident Summary:**
The web stack experienced a significant outage lasting four hours, affecting all users attempting to access our main application. Users encountered slow response times and intermittent errors, impacting approximately 80% of our user base.

**Timeline:**
- *Detected:* 2023-11-12 14:00 (UTC)
- *Detection:* Automated monitoring alerts triggered due to a sudden spike in error rates.
- *Actions Taken:* Initial investigation focused on backend services, database queries, and load balancers. Assumed a potential database bottleneck.
- *Misleading Paths:* Initially pursued a database optimization path based on monitoring metrics, which did not yield improvements.
- *Escalation:* Escalated to the DevOps and Database teams after initial investigations proved inconclusive.
- *Resolution:* Identified a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings causing uneven distribution of traffic.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- *Root Cause:* Load balancer misconfiguration resulted in an uneven distribution of traffic to backend servers, leading to increased response times and errors.
- *Resolution:* Load balancer configuration was adjusted to evenly distribute traffic across all backend servers. Additionally, implemented automated checks to alert on load balancer misconfigurations.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- *Improvements/Fixes:*
  - **Load Balancer Configuration:** Regularly review and update load balancer configurations to ensure proper distribution of traffic.
  - **Monitoring Enhancements:** Implement additional monitoring checks for load balancer health and configuration.
- *Tasks:*
  1. Conduct a thorough review of load balancer configurations and document best practices.
  2. Schedule regular load balancer health checks to ensure proper functionality.
  3. Enhance monitoring alerts to detect load balancer misconfigurations promptly.

This outage highlighted the critical need for a comprehensive review of our infrastructure and continuous monitoring. Going forward, the team is committed to proactively identifying and addressing potential issues before they impact our users.

In conclusion, this incident underscores the importance of not solely relying on automated monitoring but also maintaining a keen eye on potential misconfigurations that automated systems might overlook. The implemented corrective measures will fortify our infrastructure against similar incidents in the future.
